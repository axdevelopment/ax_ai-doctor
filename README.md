# ax_ai-doctor
AI Doctor for ESX

## Dependencies & why & how to remove
### too lazy to do it by myself, but hey! atleast you'll get an instruction on how to

- es_extended
do not remove that. don't use qb-core. just don't.

- robberies_creator
i tought that it had some nice progressbars and it even has a export for it!
this is only used because of the progressbar. you can replace that easy-Lee, since it's only 1 line inside client.lua

- b-notify
just change the notify-function at the bottom of client.lua and you're good to go.

## the original source code was taken from [hh_aidoc](https://github.com/hhfw1/hh_aidoc)'s repository named [hh_aidoc](https://github.com/hhfw1/hh_aidoc).
it has a whole lotta rework innit, changed some AI logic, fixed the callbacks and added a check to see, if the goddamn AI medic is able to get to the players position by himself.
If not, he'll get teleported - so he is (almost) always there to save ur ass!
